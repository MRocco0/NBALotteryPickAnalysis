# NBALotteryPickAnalysis
Within this project I collected data from NCSA Sports, Kaggle, and NBA.com.

Using Tableau Prep, I cleaned, joined, and exported my data tables based on College Name.

Using Tableau, I created dashboard to allow players, recruiters, and coaches to determine which school and conference produces the greatest amount of NBA Lottery Picks from 2000-2021.

Here is a link to my dashboard!
